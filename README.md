Exercise 8:
  + Initial program with """ python findShortestPath.py """
  + In the first run, we must wait more than 30min for create graph.json
  + I won't upload this json file to repo because of size
  + After that, follow the instruction.
  + We must wait about 1 min for the result and 10s for load the graph
We can get the graph.json by extracting the rar file
